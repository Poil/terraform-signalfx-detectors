  ### About filtering

  Unlike other AWS services, the tags defined by user on VPN are not fetched by SignalFx AWS
  integration as dimensions. This is why we cannot filter on [the aws tagging
  convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention#aws).

  Instead, we use the dimension `VpnId` as default filtering policy which allow you to
  specify an VPN to monitor from `vpn_id` variable. In this case, you could have to leverage [multiple
  instances](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#Multiple-instances)
  of this module to monitor different VPN providing different value for this `vpn_id`. Else, its
  default value `*` will monitor all VPN.
